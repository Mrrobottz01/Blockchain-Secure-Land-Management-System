Chapter 2. Main body.
2.1. Objectives
2.1.1 Main Objective
To develop a blockchain-based land management system that digitalizes and secures land
ownership management in Tanzania.
2..1.2 Specific Objectives
1. To develop a secure digital system for land certificate provision using blockchain
technology
2. To implement an efficient and transparent mechanism for land ownership transfer
3. To create a robust certificate verification system using smart contracts
4. To establish secure digital records management for land documentation
2.2. Literature Review
Blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative solution for land management globally,
addressing challenges like fraud, inefficiency, and lack of transparency. Below is a synthesis of
key studies and frameworks relevant to Tanzania’s context:
2.3. Blockchain in Land Administration
Blockchain, introduced by Nakamoto (2008) as the underlying technology for Bitcoin, is a
decentralized, tamper-proof ledger. Its application in land administration has gained traction due
to its ability to eliminate reliance on centralized authorities, reduce corruption, and enhance
transparency.
Decentralization and Trust:
Blockchain’s decentralized nature ensures that no single entity controls the data, reducing
opportunities for manipulation. Lemieux (2016) highlights blockchain’s potential to restore
trust in public records by providing an immutable and transparent ledger.
Global Case Studies:
Georgia: In 2016, Georgia partnered with Bitfury to implement a blockchain-based
land registry. The system reduced registration time from 3 days to minutes and cut
bureaucratic costs by 90% (World Bank, 2017). This success demonstrates
blockchain’s ability to streamline land administration and reduce fraud.
India: Andhra Pradesh piloted a blockchain land registry in 2017, resolving over
1,000 disputes by providing immutable ownership records (UN-Habitat, 2020). The
project highlighted blockchain’s potential to address land disputes in densely
populated regions.
Ghana: The Bitland initiative (2018) used blockchain to map customary lands,
demonstrating scalability in rural African contexts (AllAfrica, 2019). Bitland’s
success underscores blockchain’s applicability in regions with weak land governance
systems.
2.4. Challenges in Tanzania’s Land Management
Tanzania’s land administration faces systemic challenges that blockchain can address:
Fraud and Corruption:
A 2020 study by the Tanzanian Ministry of Lands found that 40% of land disputes in Dar es
Salaam involved forged titles (MLHHSD, 2020). Blockchain’s immutability can prevent
such fraud by ensuring that once a record is added, it cannot be altered.
Inefficiency:
Paper-based systems cause delays of 6–12 months for title transfers, stifling economic
growth (World Bank, 2019). Blockchain can automate workflows through smart contracts,
reducing delays and administrative burdens.
Digital Divide:
Rural communities lack access to verification tools, exacerbating inequality (Simbeye, 2021).
Blockchain-based mobile applications can bridge this gap by enabling offline access and
real-time verification.
2.5. Existing Solutions and Gaps
MAST (USAID):
The Mobile Application to Secure Tenure (MAST) program, implemented by USAID, has
made significant strides in digitizing land registrations in Tanzania. Between 2015 and 2021,
MAST issued over 22,000 Certificates of Customary Right of Occupancy (CCROs) in Iringa
and Mbeya districts (USAID, 2021). However, MAST’s centralized architecture limits
scalability and interoperability, creating vulnerabilities to data manipulation.
Hybrid Blockchain Models:
Studies recommend hybrid blockchains (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) for land registries,
balancing transparency with government control (Zhang et al., 2020). Hybrid models allow
governments to maintain oversight while leveraging blockchain’s decentralized benefits.
2.6. Technical Frameworks
Smart Contracts:
Ethereum-based smart contracts automate land transfers while ensuring compliance with
legal terms (Buterin, 2014). For example, a smart contract can automatically transfer
ownership once payment is confirmed, reducing the need for intermediaries.
IPFS Integration:
The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) provides decentralized file storage, securing land
documents and reducing server dependency (Benet, 2015). IPFS ensures that land records
(e.g., PDFs, maps) are stored securely and can be accessed even if one node fails.
