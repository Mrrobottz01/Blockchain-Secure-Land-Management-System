# Backend Implementation Plan

## 1. Backend Setup
- Choose and set up the backend framework (e.g., Django)
- Initialize project structure and version control
- Set up virtual environment and install dependencies

## 2. Database Design & Implementation
- Design the database schema (users, land parcels, documents, transactions, etc.)
- Implement models and migrations
- Configure database connection and environment variables

## 3. Core Backend Modules
- Implement authentication and authorization (JWT or session-based)
- User management (registration, roles, profile management)
- Land registry management (CRUD operations for land parcels)
- Document management (upload, retrieval, metadata)
- Administrative tools (user approval, system settings)

## 4. API Development
- Design RESTful API endpoints for all core modules
- Implement API views/controllers and serializers
- Add input validation and error handling
- Write API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

## 5. Integration with Blockchain & Storage
- Integrate blockchain layer for land and document verification (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric)
- Connect to IPFS or other decentralized storage for document handling
- Implement event listeners or webhooks for blockchain events

## 6. Testing & Quality Assurance
- Write unit and integration tests for backend modules and APIs
- Set up automated testing and continuous integration

## 7. Deployment Preparation
- Prepare deployment scripts and environment configuration
- Set up production database and storage
- Write deployment and maintenance documentation

# Frontend Module Implementation Progress

## Web Interface Module (`src/frontend/web/`)

This document tracks the progress of the frontend web module implementation according to the modular implementation plan.

### Implementation Steps Progress

#### 1. Set up React.js project structure with Bootstrap 5
- [x] Create React.js project using Create React App
- [x] Install Bootstrap 5 and React Bootstrap
- [x] Install Axios for API calls
- [x] Install React Router DOM for navigation
- [x] Set up proper directory structure for components

#### 2. Implement authentication and user dashboard
- [x] Create LoginForm component with validation and error handling
- [x] Create RegistrationForm component with role selection
- [x] Implement basic route protection logic
- [x] Create Dashboard component with summary cards
- [x] Set up NavigationBar component with role-based visibility

#### 3. Create land registry interface components
- [x] Implement LandRegistryInterface component
- [x] Create search functionality for land records
- [x] Add table view for displaying land parcels
- [x] Implement status indicators and filtering
- [x] Add role-based actions for different user types
- [x] Show land boundaries as polygons on map
- [x] Display land details (owner, location, size) on polygon click
- [x] Interactive map for land registration and viewing
- [x] Modal dialogs for land registration and details

#### 4. Build document management interface
- [x] Create DocumentManagement component
- [x] Implement document upload functionality with modal
- [x] Add document filtering and search
- [x] Include blockchain verification indicators
- [x] Add IPFS integration messaging

#### 5. Develop administrative tools and reports
- [x] Create AdminDashboard component with tabbed interface
- [x] Implement user management section with approval workflows
- [x] Add system statistics dashboard with visual indicators
- [x] Create system settings configuration panel
- [x] Add blockchain monitoring tools

### Next Steps
1. Connect to Backend APIs:
   - Replace mock data with actual API calls
   - Implement proper error handling for API responses
   - Set up authentication token management

2. State Management:
   - Implement global state management (Redux or Context API)
   - Manage authentication state across components

3. User Experience Enhancements:
   - Add more robust form validation
   - Implement loading skeletons/spinners
   - Add toast notifications for user actions

4. Blockchain Integration:
   - Connect document verification to blockchain integration layer
   - Implement real-time blockchain status monitoring

## Mobile Application Module (`src/frontend/mobile/`)
- [ ] Not started yet - will be implemented after web interface is complete

## Current Status
- Date: April 15, 2025
- Current focus: Web Interface Module complete, ready for backend integration
- All core web components implemented according to the implementation plan
- Need to proceed with backend implementation before further frontend development

## Notes
- The web module is currently using mock data which will be replaced with actual API calls once the backend is implemented
- Authentication is simulated and will need to be connected to the actual authentication service
- Blockchain integration is prepared but will need the blockchain modules to be implemented
