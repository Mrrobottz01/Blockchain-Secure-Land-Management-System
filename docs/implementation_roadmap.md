## Risk Management

### Identified Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. **Technical Complexity**
   - *Risk*: Blockchain technology learning curve may delay development
   - *Mitigation*: Allocate sufficient time for learning, utilize available tutorials and resources, consider consulting with blockchain experts if necessary

2. **Integration Challenges**
   - *Risk*: Difficulty integrating multiple technologies (blockchain, IPFS, web/mobile)
   - *Mitigation*: Create clear integration interfaces early, develop proof-of-concept for critical integrations, use modular design

3. **Performance Issues**
   - *Risk*: System may not handle required transaction volume
   - *Mitigation*: Regular performance testing, optimize smart contracts, implement caching strategies

4. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - *Risk*: Sensitive land data could be compromised
   - *Mitigation*: Regular security audits, follow security best practices, implement comprehensive testing

5. **Scope Creep**
   - *Risk*: Project requirements may expand beyond initial scope
   - *Mitigation*: Clear project boundaries, change management process, prioritize core features

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

1. The system successfully records and verifies land certificates on the blockchain
2. Ownership transfers can be securely executed through the system
3. Documents can be stored and retrieved from IPFS with proper authentication
4. The web and mobile interfaces provide intuitive access to system functions
5. The system meets all security and performance requirements
6. All milestone deliverables have been completed
7. Project documentation is comprehensive and complete
