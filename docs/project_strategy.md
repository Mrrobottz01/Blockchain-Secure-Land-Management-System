# Strategic Plan for Blockchain-based Land Management System

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for implementing a blockchain-based land management system for Tanzania as part of the FYP project. The system aims to address key issues in Tanzania's current land registry system including fraud, corruption, inefficiency, and limited access.

## Project Timeline & Phases

| Phase | Description | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1. Project Understanding & Research | Initial research and environment setup | 2-3 weeks |
| 2. Learning & Skill Development | Acquire necessary technical skills | 3-4 weeks |
| 3. System Design & Architecture | Create technical documentation and design | 2-3 weeks |
| 4. Development Phase | Implement backend, blockchain, and frontend | 10-12 weeks |
| 5. Testing Phase | Perform comprehensive testing | 3-4 weeks |
| 6. Deployment & Documentation | Deploy and document the system | 2-3 weeks |

## Phase Details

### 1. Project Understanding & Research Phase (2-3 weeks)

#### Initial Research
- Review the current proposal document in detail
- Gather additional resources on blockchain land registry systems with focus on case studies (Georgia, India, Ghana)
- Study Hyperledger Fabric documentation
- Research IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for document storage

#### Environment Setup
- Organize project folder structure (complete)
  - `docs/`: For project documentation and reports
  - `research/`: For storing research papers and references  
  - `src/`: Main source code divided into backend, frontend, blockchain
  - `tests/`: For unit and integration tests
  - `design/`: For system architecture diagrams, UI mockups

#### Requirements Analysis
- Create detailed functional requirements document
- Define non-functional requirements (security, performance, usability)
- Develop user stories for different stakeholders (landowners, government officials, etc.)

### 2. Learning & Skill Development (3-4 weeks)

#### Backend Development
- Learn Django framework basics
- Set up PostgreSQL database and practice with it
- Create simple RESTful APIs with Django

#### Frontend Development
- Master Bootstrap 5 fundamentals

- Set up IPFS nodes and connect to application

### 5. Testing Phase (3-4 weeks)

#### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for system flows
- Security testing (vulnerability assessment)
- User acceptance testing

#### Performance Optimization
- Identify and fix bottlenecks
- Optimize blockchain operations
- Ensure mobile app works efficiently

### 6. Deployment & Documentation (2-3 weeks)

#### Deployment
