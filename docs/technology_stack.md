# Technology Stack Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the technology stack to be used in the blockchain-based land management system for Tanzania. The stack has been carefully selected to align with the project requirements for security, scalability, and functionality.

## Backend Development

### Django Framework (Python)
- **Version:** Latest stable (Django 4.x or newer)
- **Purpose:** Server-side application development, REST API creation
- **Justification:** Django provides robust security features, admin interface, ORM, and excellent documentation
- **Key Components:**
  - Django REST framework for API development
  - Django ORM for database interactions
  - Django Admin for administrative interface

### PostgreSQL Database
- **Version:** Latest stable (14.x or newer)
- **Purpose:** Primary relational database storage
- **Justification:** 
  - ACID compliance for data integrity
  - Advanced indexing and search capabilities
  - Good performance with complex queries
  - Excellent support for geographic data (PostGIS extension)

### Redis
- **Purpose:** Caching and session management
- **Justification:** Improves performance by reducing database load

## Frontend Development

### Web Application
- **Framework:** Bootstrap 5
- **JavaScript Libraries:** 
  - React.js for dynamic interface components
  - Axios for API communication
- **CSS Preprocessor:** SASS
- **Purpose:** Responsive web interface for desktop and tablet access
- **Justification:** Bootstrap provides responsive design out of the box with excellent cross-browser compatibility

### Mobile Application
- **Framework:** Flutter
- **Language:** Dart
- **Purpose:** Native-like mobile application for field operations
- **Justification:**
  - Cross-platform (iOS/Android) development from single codebase
  - Good performance on low-end devices common in rural areas
  - Offline capability for areas with poor connectivity

## Blockchain Implementation

### Hyperledger Fabric
- **Version:** Latest stable (2.x)
- **Purpose:** Enterprise blockchain framework
- **Justification:**
  - Permissioned blockchain suitable for land registry
  - Modular architecture supporting multiple consensus mechanisms
  - Private channels for sensitive data
  - Support for smart contracts (chaincode)
  - Better performance compared to public blockchains

### IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
- **Purpose:** Decentralized storage for land documents
- **Justification:**
  - Content-addressed storage preventing document tampering
  - Distributed architecture improving document availability
  - Efficient storage reducing duplication

### Smart Contracts
- **Language:** Go (for Hyperledger Fabric chaincode)
- **Key Contracts:**
  - Land Certificate Issuance Contract
  - Ownership Transfer Contract
  - Certificate Verification Contract
  - Document Authentication Contract

## Development & Deployment Tools

### Version Control
- **System:** Git
- **Repository Hosting:** GitHub or GitLab

### Containerization & Deployment
- **Container Technology:** Docker
- **Container Orchestration:** Docker Compose (development), Kubernetes (production)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or Jenkins

### Testing Tools
- **Backend Testing:** pytest (Python)
- **Frontend Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library
- **Blockchain Testing:** Hyperledger Caliper
- **API Testing:** Postman

## Hardware Requirements

### Development Environment
- **Processor:** Intel Core i5/i7 or AMD equivalent
- **RAM:** 16GB minimum recommended
- **Storage:** 512GB SSD minimum
- **OS:** Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux (Ubuntu/Parrot OS)

### Deployment Environment
- **Option 1: Cloud Hosting**
  - AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean
  - Kubernetes cluster for production
  - Minimum 4 nodes for Hyperledger Fabric network
  
- **Option 2: On-Premises**
  - Server-grade hardware with redundancy
  - Minimum 32GB RAM per server
  - Fast SSD storage for database operations
  - Reliable network connectivity

### Mobile Testing Devices
- At least one Android and one iOS device for testing
- Range of screen sizes to test responsive design

## Security Considerations
- SSL/TLS for all communications
- JWT for API authentication
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
